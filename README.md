# media-dilutor
This is media-dilutor, a *very* simple Python script to calculate media dilutions quickly.

Currently, only additive dilutions are included. Starting with a set volume of media $m$, and with other 'dilutors' $d_x$ of initial starting concentrations $d_ci$ and desired concentrations $d_cf$, calculate the volumes required to add to $m$.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. pip

## Install
```Python
pip install ...
```
