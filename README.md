# media-dilutor
This is media-dilutor, a *very* simple Python script to calculate media dilutions quickly.

Currently, only additive dilutions are included: 
> Starting with a set volume of media $m$, and with other 'dilutors' $d_x$ of initial starting concentrations $d_{ci}$ and desired concentrations $d_{cf}$, calculate the volumes required to add to $m$.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x

## Install
```Python
pip install git+https://github.com/bk1n/media-dilutor.git
```

## Usage
See example.py for example usage.
